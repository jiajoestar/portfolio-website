## portfolio website
date: february 2024\
a portfolio website i made for my university assignment.\
it includes a home page, portfolio page and contact me page.\
the 'portfolio' page includes only a few of my projects, with brief descriptions and links to their respective github repositories.\
the 'contact me' page is supposed to allow a person to submit a project request with details such as name, project duration and a short description, but it is not currently working.
#### still a work in progress !
